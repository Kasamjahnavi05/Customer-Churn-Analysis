### 📊  Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Project (In My Point of View)

- This project is my Power BI analysis on customer churn. I built this dashboard to understand why customers leave a service and what factors contribute to churn. My goal was to explore the data clearly and present meaningful insights using interactive visuals.

### 🧩 Project Overview

 - I created this Power BI report to identify the main reasons behind customer churn. By analysing demographics, services, billing, and contract details, I was able to understand which customers are at higher risk of leaving.

### 🎯 Objectives of My Project

- To identify the overall churn rate and retention level.
- To understand how factors like gender, age, and tenure influence churn.
- To analyse how phone service, internet plans, and add-on services affect           customer decisions.
- To study churn based on contract duration and payment methods.
- To highlight key churn drivers using visual insights.

###  Insights From My Dashboard

| Area                     | What I Found                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Demographics**         | Senior citizens and low-tenure customers have higher churn.             |
| **Service Subscription** | Fiber optic users churn more; customers with fewer services churn less. |
| **Contracts**            | Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate.                   |
| **Billing**              | Electronic check users churn the most; automated payments reduce churn. |
| **Key Drivers**          | Contract type, internet service, and tenure are major influencers.      |
------

### 🔍 Key Insights I Observed
-  Month-to-month customers leave more often.
- Fiber optic internet has a high churn rate.
- Electronic check users are more likely to churn.
- Customers with low tenure (under 12 months) are at higher risk.
- Churn has a clear impact on revenue.
