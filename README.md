📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Project (In My Point of View)

This project is my Power BI analysis on customer churn. I built this dashboard to understand why customers leave a service and what factors contribute to churn. My goal was to explore the data clearly and present meaningful insights using interactive visuals.

| **Page 1: Customer Demographics**          | I analysed gender distribution, senior citizenship, tenure, monthly charges, and overall churn count. |
| **Page 2: Service Subscription**           | I studied how phone service, internet type, and add-on services affect churn.                         |
| **Page 3: Contract & Billing**             | I checked churn based on contract types, payment methods, monthly and total charges.                  |
| **Page 4: Churn Prediction & Key Drivers** | I explored churn behaviour by contract, internet service type, gender, and overall revenue impact.    |
🧩 Project Overview

I created this Power BI report to identify the main reasons behind customer churn. By analysing demographics, services, billing, and contract details, I was able to understand which customers are at higher risk of leaving.

🎯 Objectives of My Project

To identify the overall churn rate and retention level.

To understand how factors like gender, age, and tenure influence churn.

To analyse how phone service, internet plans, and add-on services affect customer decisions.

To study churn based on contract duration and payment methods.

To highlight key churn drivers using visual insights.

| **Demographics**         | Senior citizens and low-tenure customers have higher churn.             |
| **Service Subscription** | Fiber optic users churn more; customers with fewer services churn less. |
| **Contracts**            | Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate.                   |
| **Billing**              | Electronic check users churn the most; automated payments reduce churn. |
| **Key Drivers**          | Contract type, internet service, and tenure are major influencers.      |
