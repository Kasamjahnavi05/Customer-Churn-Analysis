# Customer-Churn-Analysis
I worked on a **Customer Churn Analysis** project to identify customers likely to stop using services. Using **Power BI**, I analyzed customer data and created dashboards showing churn trends, retention rates, and high-risk groups. This project improved my analytical skills and understanding of data-driven business decisions.
